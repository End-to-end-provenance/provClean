Description: To create clearer, more concise code provides this
	     toolbox helps coders to isolate the essential parts of a script that
	     produces a chosen result, such as an object, tables and figures
	     written to disk and even warnings and errors. This project was
	     derived from Rclean 1.0.1. (https://github.com/ProvTools/Rclean).  This work
	     was funded by US National Science Foundation grant
	     SSI-1450277 for applications of End-to-End Data Provenance.
